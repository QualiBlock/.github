## Reporting a Vulnerability

We at QualiBlock consider security as one of our core principles. If you have identified a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Email Us Directly**: Rather than creating a public issue, send the details of the vulnerability to our security team at [qualiblock@outlook.com](mailto:qualiblock+github@outlook.com). This helps in maintaining confidentiality.

2. **Vulnerability Assessment**: We will evaluate the reported vulnerability for its severity and impact, ensuring a prompt and thorough review.

3. **Initial Response**: Expect an acknowledgment from us within 48 hours, with a roadmap for addressing the issue.

4. **Investigation and Mitigation**: Our team will meticulously investigate and validate the vulnerability. If confirmed, we will create an appropriate fix and mitigation plan.

5. **Security Patch**: We will release updates for the affected versions, ensuring all users have access to the latest security enhancements.

6. **Responsible Disclosure**: In line with our commitment to transparency and community collaboration, we will disclose the details of the vulnerability after the patches are made available. This approach ensures that users can update their systems before the information is publicly shared.

Your contributions to the security of QualiBlock's projects are invaluable. By working together, we can create a safer and more innovative technological ecosystem. Thank you for your dedication and collaboration.
