## How to Report a Vulnerability

Security is a core principle at QualiBlock. If you discover a security vulnerability, please take the following steps to report it:

1. **Contact Us via Email**: Do not report the vulnerability publicly. Instead, email the details confidentially to our security team at [security@qualiblock.tech](mailto:security@qualiblock.tech).
2. **Assessment of the Vulnerability**: Our team will evaluate the vulnerability for severity and impact, ensuring a prompt and comprehensive review.
3. **Acknowledgment**: We aim to acknowledge your report within 48 hours and will provide a roadmap for addressing the vulnerability.
4. **Investigation and Remediation**: After validating the reported vulnerability, we will develop a fix and a mitigation strategy.
5. **Security Patch Release**: Updates will be released for affected versions to give all users access to the necessary security enhancements.
6. **Responsible Disclosure**: Once patches are available, we will disclose the vulnerability details publicly. This ensures users can update their systems before the information becomes public knowledge.
