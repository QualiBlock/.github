## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and encourage the community to report any potential issues. To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a GitHub Issue**: Go to the Issues section of this repository and create a new issue. Choose the "Security Vulnerability" issue template and provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability you have identified.

2. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Our security team will review the reported vulnerability and assess its severity and impact.

3. **Initial Response**: You can expect an initial response from us within 48 hours, acknowledging the receipt of your report and providing further details on the next steps.

4. **Investigation and Mitigation**: Our team will investigate the reported vulnerability to verify its authenticity and understand its potential impact. If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on developing a fix and mitigation strategy.

5. **Security Patch**: Once a security patch is ready, we will release updates for the affected versions as well as the latest stable version.

6. **Public Disclosure**: We believe in responsible disclosure. Once the vulnerability is fixed and patches are available, we will coordinate the release of information about the vulnerability. This ensures users have time to update their installations before details are made public.

We appreciate your contributions to our project's security and look forward to working collaboratively to address any vulnerabilities. Your diligence helps make the software ecosystem safer for everyone.
